👋 Hello community, my name is Ralf
- 👀 I’m interested in Raspberry, "add on's" and in general IoT development in a small, semi-professional environment
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Git for my own little project(s) and getting my environment for the development cycle up and running
- 💞️ Happy to get hints what to improve, what to push and what to NOT do.
- 📫 You can reach me under ralf@r-raimann.de
